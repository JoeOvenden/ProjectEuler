
get all primes below 1 million
        
for each prime, p, below 1 million 
    find the longest consecutive prime sum that starts with p
        start with the trivial case of just p = p
        while the sum is less than 1 million
            add the next consecutive prime to the sum
            check that the sum is prime, and if it is longer than the previous longest sum
                if true, then store both the number of summands and the sum total
                
print first summand, total number of summands and the sum total
